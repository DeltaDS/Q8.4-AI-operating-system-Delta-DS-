## How To Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, and you don't need a PhD to do so, we've spec'd up a few pathways for contributing to help you get started:

* [Academic](#academic)
* [Documentation Writing](#documentation)
* [Graphics Design](#graphics)
* [Electronics Engineering](#electronics)
* [Software Engineering](#software)

Not sure? That's okay, we also have some easier ways to contribute:

* [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
* [New Ideas](#new-ideas)

### Academic

There are many ways an academic can contribute to the project, below are just a few examples of the type of contributions that would really help this project:

1. Writing & validating proofs
2. Developing new algorithms to improve design & efficiency
3. Quantum optics component design, validation, and testing
4. Quantum circuit simulations

### Documentation

No project can survive without good documentation, and this project needs a lot of it! Documentation contributors help to not just orient newcomers, but also enable all teams to work together. Here are some of the contributions we're looking for:

1. Translations
2. Editing & proofreading
3. Tutorial writing

### Graphics

Are you artistically inclined? Let your creativity roam free by creating graphics - instructional, educational, or just plain cool for the project! I don't really know much about graphic design, if you have any ideas feel free to share them! It would be really awesome if someone could design a nice logo for the project :)

### Electronics

Enjoy hardware hacking? Whether you're an expert in routing high-speed, differential signals or a complete beginner to electronics design, this project has room for you. The type of contributions we are looking for are:

1. Custom component design
2. Circuit analysis/Simulation
3. Schematic Design & Verification
4. PCB Layout & Verification
5. Gerber & assembly file verification (manufacturer specific)
6. Mixed-signal analysis
7. Integrity Analysis
8. Parts compatibility selection

#### Tools Used

| Tool               | Purpose                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| [KiCAD](kicad.org) | Schematic & PCB Design |
| GTKWave            | Circuit Simulation     |
